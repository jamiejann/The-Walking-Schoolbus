   - Using GitLab issues to track features to work on.
   - Use Git/GitLab branchs and GitLab merge requests 
   - Correctly builds when cloned from GitLab.

[ 0] Good quality code (worth 0, but up to a 20 mark penalty may be applied).
   - Good class, method, variable names.
   - Perfectly formatted code.
   - Comments on all classes (not needed *inside* classes, just on the class level)
   - All strings which end user may see on UI (not LogCat) are in strings.xml

	 

General Notes:
- UI must be in a separated package from the data "Model".
- Use a singleton pattern to allow all parts of the UI to access the model.
- From any screen, the Android back button must do the "reasonable" thing.
- Strings shown to the user must be in string.xml
