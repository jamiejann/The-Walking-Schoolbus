Walking Group: Iteration 1


[15] Create Account, Log in/out
   - Create new user
   - Automatic log in
   - Log out (and disables automatic log-in until re-logged-in)
  

[25] Manage Account Monitoring
   - See list of who they monitor and whom monitors them
   - Add/remove uses to or fonm these lists (either self, or someone they monitor).

[40] Manage Walking Group
   - Show map centred on GPS location
   - See existing groups on the map
   - Able to join self (or someone the user monitors) to the group.
   - Able to remove self (or someone the user monitors) from the group.
  
   
[10] Overall
   - Application flows smoothly.
   - Reasonable software architecture. Must have model in different package than UI. Should use singleton pattern.
   - Nice UI layouts; resizes to different size screens reasonably well.

[10] Correct use of Git and GitLab
   - Using GitLab issues to track features to work on.
   - Use Git/GitLab branchs and GitLab merge requests 
   - Correctly builds when cloned from GitLab.

[ 0] Good quality code (worth 0, but up to a 20 mark penalty may be applied).
   - Good class, method, variable names.
   - Perfectly formatted code.
   - Comments on all classes (not needed *inside* classes, just on the class level)
   - All strings which end user may see on UI (not LogCat) are in strings.xml




	 

General Notes:
- UI must be in a separated package from the data "Model".
- Use a singleton pattern to allow all parts of the UI to access the model.
- From any screen, the Android back button must do the "reasonable" thing.
- Strings shown to the user must be in string.xml
