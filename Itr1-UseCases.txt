Walking Group: Iteration 1

1. Craete Account, Log-in, Log-out,
------------------------------------------
- A new user (a parent or a child) launches app and signs up using their name, email, and sets a password.
    Email addreses are used to uniquely identify accounts.
- After logging in, if user closes app and relaunches it then the app remembers log-in info and automatically logs in.
- Once logged in, a user can log-out. 
    While logged out, the user will not automatically be re-logged in if the app is restarted.


2. Manage Account Monitoring
------------------------------------------
The app supports one user (likely a parent) "monitoring" the account of another user (likely a child/student).
A user may have 0 or more users monitoring them, and they may monitor 0 or more other users.
- User can list the users whom they monitor, and who monitors them.
    Should show at least the name and email of the other account.
- User can remove anyone from the list of users whom they monitor, and who monitors them.
- User can add another user to the set of users they monitor (add their child).
    The child account must already exist and is identified by its email address.
- User can add another user to the set of users who monitor them (add their parent).
    The parent account must already exist and is identified by its email address.


3. Create, View, and Join a Walking Group
------------------------------------------
- User can see on a map, centred on their GPS coordinates, walking groups around them.
- User can create a new walking group by specifying a meeting place for the group and the destination.
     User gives the group a name once they create it.
- User can select an existing walking group from the map and join it.
     User can join either themselves, or any user they monitor (their child) to the group.
- User can leave any group they are part of, or remove a user they monitor (their child) from the group.
     User may be a member of any number of groups.

	 

General Notes:
- UI must be in a separated package from the data "Model".
- Use a singleton pattern to allow all parts of the UI to access the model.
- From any screen, the Android back button must do the "reasonable" thing.
- Strings shown to the user must be in string.xml
