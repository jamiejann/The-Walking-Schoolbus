Iteration 2 Use-Cases / User Stories
====================================

------------------------------------
User Information
------------------------------------
* As a user of the system, I am able to see and edit my own information, all of which is optional, which includes: 
	- name, birth year & birth month, address, 
	- home phone, cell phone
	- email, 
	- current grade and teacher's name (which is meaningful only if I'm a student)
	- emergency contact info (free text which may include person's name, relationship to 
	      user, email, phone numbers, etc. This is only meaningful if I'm a student.)

* As a parent of a child using the system, I am able to see and edit the information of anyone I monitor (my children), which includes the same type of information as entered about me (see above)
	
	
------------------------------------
Walking Groups
------------------------------------
* As a group leader, when I select a walking group I lead, I can see the names of users who are members in the walking group, plus for each of those members I can see more in-depth info on all users who monitor them. I use this to remember the names of kids in my walking group, plus look up contact info of their parents whenever I need to contact them (such as for a problem related to their child, or planning a weekend BBQ with all members of the walking group and their parents).

* As a member of a walking group, when I select the group I am in I can see the names of users who are members in the walking group, plus for each of those members I can see more in-depth info on all users who monitor them. I use this to remember the names of other kids in my walking group, plus look up contact info of their parents whenever there is a problem and I need to contact them.

* As a parent with children in walking groups, when I select the group which my child is a member of, I can see the names of users who are members in the walking group, plus for each of those members I can see more in-depth info on all users who monitor them. I use this to know the names of other kids my child is walking with, plus look up contact info of their parents whenever there is a problem and I need to contact them.

On Walk Features
------------------------------------
* As a member of a group, or a leader of a group, when I'm walking with the group I am able to start the app uploading my GPS location to the server. It uploads my location every 30 seconds so that those who monitor me (or who monitor members of my group if I am the leader) may know where I am. I am able to stop the uploading once I get to school, and the uploading automatically stops 10 minutes after I have reached school.

* As a parent with a child in a walking group, I use the in-app Parent's Dashboard feature, which shows a map, to see the last reported location of my child and the leader as they walk with the group. The parent's dashboard also allows me to see all my children (users I monitor) at once so I can, at a glance, know they are safe and walking it to school as expected. 

* As a parent using the parent's dashboard, for each user that I see on the map it indicates how long it has been since that user's latest location was updated. This helps me know if location data is still being received from the users.

In-App Messages
------------------------------------
* As a user, I am able to view any messages which have been sent to me. I can see which messages are read vs unread. From Parent's Dashboard I can always see how many new messages are waiting for me, and easily view such messages. App checks for new (or unread) messages every minute. This allows me to receive messages from my children, children in my group, or the leader of a group I'm a member of.

* As the leader of a walking group, I am able able to send out broadcast messages to all members of my group, and those who monitor members of my group. These messages are just plain text. I may use this before we meet up to announce I am unable to go today (such as sick), or a reminder of something (such as bring an umbrella for the rain expected later). While on the walk I may use this to notify all parents of members of my group that there is an issue, such as we were unable to get to class due to police incident, or being chased by a dog.

* As a child who walks with a walking group, when I am walking I am able to press a panic button and optionally enter a message (plain text) to indicate that I am having a problem on the walk (likely an emergency). This will notify all users who monitor me (my parents), plus the group leader of any groups I am in. It allows me to quickly report a problem so that I may receive help from them, or to let them know about an emergency. 

* As a child who walks with a walking group, when I am walking I am able to send a message (plain text) to all users who monitor me (my parents) and the group leader of any groups I am in. This allows me to let them know of something such as I'm running late, the group never showed up, or some other non-emergency situation. This allows me to use the app to communicate with my parents, but not send an emergency panic message.
